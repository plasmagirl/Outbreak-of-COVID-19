# Outbreak-of-COVID-19

This project analyzes the epidemiological outbreak of COVID-19 from January 22, 2020 to now. 
The data is available from the [2019-Novel Coronavirus Data Repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) by John Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. It is also supported by the ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL).
The data is collated from multiple sources over the world and is updated daily. As a result, we can get up to date information by reloading the data everyday.

To get the interactive view of the notebook, go to [Jupyter nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), copy the ipynb link and paste it in the space provided.
